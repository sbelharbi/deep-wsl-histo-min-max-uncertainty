    https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/issues/1512

    We need our own collate function that wraps things up (imge, mask, label, size). (size is the ratio of the
    positive regions (glands) to the entire mask).

    In this setup,  batch is a list of tuples (the result of calling: img, mask, label = PhotoDataset[i].
    The output of this function is four elements:
        . data: a pytorch tensor of size (batch_size, c, h, w) of float32 . Each sample is a tensor of shape (c, h_,
        w_) that represents a cropped patch from an image (or the entire image) where: c is the depth of the patches (
        since they are RGB, so c=3),  h is the height of the patch, and w_ is the its width.
        . mask: a list of pytorch tensors of size (batch_size, 1, h, w) full of 1 and 0. The mask of the ENTIRE image (no
        cropping is performed). Images does not have the same size, and the same thing goes for the masks. Therefore,
        we can't put the masks in one tensor.
        . target: a vector (pytorch tensor) of length batch_size of type torch.LongTensor containing the image-level
        labels.

               Useful for the evaluation datasets such
               as the validation set or the test test. If True we do all
               that, else the preparation of the data is
               done when needed. If  dataset if LARGE AND you inscrease the
               size of the samples through a processing
               step (upscaling for instance), we recommend to set this to
               False since you will need to a large memory.
               In this case, the validation will be slow (you can increase
               the number of workers if you use a batch

        :param force_div_32 [used only during evaluation time): bool.
               If True, the evaluation image is padded in way to have a size
               (h, w) that are both dividable by 32 (so the up-scaled mask
               matches the image).
        :param up_scale_small_dim_to: int or None. If not None,
               we SCALE (up or down) the small dimension (height or width) to
               this value (then compute the upscale ration r). Then, scale the
               other dimension to a proportional value (using
               the ratio r). This is helpful when the images have either
               a small or large dim. Due to the model's depth, small images may
               'disappear' or provide a very small attention map. in the
               other hand, large images could be problematic.
        :param do_not_save_samples: Bool. If True, we do not save samples in
               memory.The default behavior of the code is to preload the
               samples, and save them in memory to speedup access and to
               avoid disc access. However, this may be impractical when
               dealing with large dataset during the final processing (
               evaluation). It is not necessary to keep the samples of the
               dataset in the memory once they are processed.
               Consequences to this boolean flag: If it is True, we do not
               preload sample (read from disc), AND once a
               sample is loaded, it is not stored. There few things that we
               save: 1. The size of the sample (h, w).in
               self.original_images_size.
               We remind that this flag is useful only at the end of the
               training when you want to evaluate on a set
               (train, valid, test). In this case, there is no need to store
               anything. If the dataset is large,
               this will cause memory overflow (in case you run your code on a
               server with reserved amount of memory).
               If you set this flag to True, use 0 workers for the dataloader,
               since we will be processing the samples
               sequentially, and we want to avoid to load a sample ahead (no
               point of doing that).
